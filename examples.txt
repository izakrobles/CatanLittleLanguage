The game begins with "start game {list of players}"
Each player must begin their turn with rolling dice
Once a player has rolled dice their turn can end, or they can take an action
actions include drawing a development card(knight, victory, year of plenty, monopoly, road building), building a structure (road, city, or settlement), trade resources (brick, lumber, wool, grain, or ore), or using a development card
(note: players can take more than one action in their turn)
